Once the mother is pregnant, if she does not have enough vitamins in their blood, the baby will not develop well his/her brain and this damage cannot be prevented. Most neural tube defect cases including anencephaly can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and early stage of pregnancy.  Health-seeking behavior, saving money for delivery, good nutrition, and early initiation of ANC helps in preventing similar kinds of problems.  Advice for health facility:  this severe neural tube defect could be detected earlier in the pregnancy and advised the mother to do a closer follow-up. Spina bifida caused hydrocephalus, which made difficult the delivery. With better ANC care and early diagnosis of NTDs, a planned early termination of pregnancy to avoid intrauterine fetal distress could be done. Spina bifida can be corrected after birth and it does not necessarily cause death.   Advice for health authorities: neural tube defect is very prevalent in Ethiopia, and spina bifida is the most common clinical presentation. It is well known that folate deficiency in pregnant women has the potential to impact the prevalence of these neural tube defects and then to avoid them, an adequate level of folic acid in the mother's blood should be at the time of conception. However, Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa with no folic acid fortification. Therefore, there is an urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent the majority of spina bifida and anencephaly cases.   \"\n",

Once the mother is pregnant, if she does not have enough vitamins in their blood, the baby will not develop well his/her brain and this damage cannot be prevented. Most neural tube defect cases including anencephaly can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and early stage of pregnancy.  Health-seeking behavior, saving money for delivery, good nutrition, and early initiation of ANC helps in preventing similar kinds of problems.  Advice for health facility:  this severe neural tube defect could be detected earlier in the pregnancy and advised the mother to do a closer follow-up. Spina bifida caused hydrocephalus, which made difficult the delivery. With better ANC care and early diagnosis of NTDs, a planned early termination of pregnancy to avoid intrauterine fetal distress could be done. Spina bifida can be corrected after birth and it does not necessarily cause death.   Advice for health authorities: neural tube defect is very prevalent in Ethiopia, and spina bifida is the most common clinical presentation. It is well known that folate deficiency in pregnant women has the potential to impact the prevalence of these neural tube defects and then to avoid them, an adequate level of folic acid in the mother's blood should be at the time of conception. However, Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa with no folic acid fortification. Therefore, there is an urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent the majority of spina bifida and anencephaly cases.   \"\n",

It is well known that folate deficiency in pregnant women has a potential for impact on the prevalence of these neural tube defects and then to avoid them, adequate level of folic acid in mother's blood should be at the time of conception. However, Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa with no folic acid fortification. So, there is an urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all of folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent 96% of spina bifida and anencephaly cases.   \"\n",
