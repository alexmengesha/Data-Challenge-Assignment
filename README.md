### Title: Predicting Child Mortality using Machine Learning Techniques through Analysis of Infant Underlying Causes and Maternal Factors data using Ethiopian Public Health Institute(EPHI)

### Introduction

Child mortality remains a daunting challenge globally, with millions of children succumbing to preventable causes before reaching the age of five. Despite notable strides in healthcare and socio-economic development, disparities persist, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries. Addressing child mortality requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses understanding the complex interplay of factors contributing to these deaths. This study endeavors to delve into the underlying causes and maternal factors associated with child mortality, aiming to inform targeted interventions and policies to mitigate this pressing public health issue.

### Statement of Problem

The persistence of high child mortality rates underscores the urgency of understanding the factors driving these deaths. Socio-economic inequities, inadequate healthcare access, maternal health disparities, and environmental factors all play pivotal roles in determining a child's survival chances. Despite concerted efforts to curb child mortality, challenges such as limited resources, infrastructure gaps, and systemic barriers impede progress. Identifying the specific drivers of child mortality and elucidating actionable insights from data are critical steps toward implementing effective interventions and achieving sustainable reductions in child mortality rates.

## Methodology

#### Data Collection

A robust dataset encompassing demographic information, case types, infant underlying causes, and maternal factors was collected by Ethiopia Public Health Institute(EPHI) in National Data Management Center from Ethiopia to provide comprehensive insights into child mortality determinants.

### Data Analysis

Employing a blend of data Preprocessing, descriptive analytics, data visualization, and advanced machine learning techniques and model evaluation was done, the dataset was meticulously analyzed to uncover patterns, correlations, and predictive models associated with child mortality interms of infant underline cause and maternal factors.

### Classification Modeling

Using a suite of classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoostClassifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and XGBOOST, predictive models were developed to discern the most salient predictors of child mortality. Feature engineering and selection methodologies were applied to identify key features driving mortality outcomes.

### Results and Discussion

### Feature Importance

The analysis underscored the pivotal role of 'infant underlying cause' and 'maternal factors' in shaping child mortality outcomes across various classification models. 
These findings highlight the intricate interplay between maternal health, infant care practices, and child survival rates. 
Any concerned bodies, academiciaons , practioneries should give match attension for these factors to prevent child mortality.
### Top Underlying Causes and Maternal Factors

Visualization techniques elucidated the top five infant underlying causes and maternal factors contributing to child mortality.
These are 
Insights gleaned from these visualizations serve as invaluable guideposts for crafting targeted interventions and policy frameworks aimed at averting child deaths.

## Conclusions and Future Considerations

In conclusion, this study elucidates the multifaceted nature of child mortality and underscores the imperative of holistic approaches to address this pressing public health concern. By prioritizing investments in maternal and child healthcare, bolstering healthcare infrastructure, and implementing evidence-based interventions, tangible progress can be made in reducing child mortality rates. Moreover, concerted efforts to tackle socio-economic disparities, enhance healthcare accessibility, and foster international collaboration are indispensable for achieving sustainable gains in child health outcomes. Future research endeavors should focus on evaluating the efficacy of intervention strategies, monitoring progress towards global targets, and fostering cross-sectoral partnerships to advance child survival agendas on a global scale.
